# Carbon-benefit-IT-Refurbishment
Returns the carbon benefit of reuse of an IT asset compared to recycling.

This carbon benefit calculation measures the the carbon benefit of reuse with Global Resale compared to the next owner of the IT product buying new.
“Reuse” here refers to when a product that is no longer needed by its owner (“User 1”) is taken over by a new user (“User 2”) who has a need for it, instead of it becoming waste.

Reusing is the second most desirable way to reduce our waste, right after “prevention” of production, according to the EU Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/EC).  Reuse is, therefore, better than recycling the product, which is the next most likely solution for IT Asset Disposition.

This carbon calculation calculates the carbon avoided by reusing assets compared to recycling. 
The calculation provides the carbon benefit in kg CO2e, and this document provides context for what the calculation means, and the methodology and databases used to reach the figures.

We assume that User 2, who purchases the used asset, would have bought new if they had not bought a used product. We can then calculate the carbon savings of re-use.

The carbon benefit calculation is a counter-factual conditional statement. A counterfactual conditional statement makes a conditional claim about something that did not happen – ‘if I had not gone on a run at 9:00 a.m., my heartbeat would have been lower at 9:30 a.m.’ 
The carbon benefit calculation’s counter-factional conditional statement says, ‘if you hadn’t re-used your assets through Global resale, the carbon emission, as a result, would have been X kg CO2e higher.’

You can use this calculation to say, ‘By choosing reuse, we avoided X kg CO2e emissions.’
This is not a carbon offset, and does not satisfy PAS 2060:2014. 
As such, the components of this calculation  should never be used to claim a carbon offset, or any contribution to carbon neutrality or net zero, by any party.
